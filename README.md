**A smarter, AI-assisted web fuzzing tool...**
## Quick Start
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sammed101/FuzzAI.git
cd FuzzAI
```
Or download via curl:
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/Sammed101/FuzzAI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
cd FuzzAI-main
```
### 2. Install dependencies
It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment to avoid package conflicts.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Run FuzzAI
```bash
python3 fuzzai.py -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w wordlists/test.txt  # Tests if it works correctly
```
❗If any issue occurs while running or installing refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Features
🔍 ****AI Wordlist Selection****  
Automatically picks the most relevant wordlist from SecLists based on user intent.

🧠 ****GPT Wordlist Generation****  
Create custom wordlists on the fly using OpenAI (e.g., numbers, patterns, contexts).

 🧹****Advanced Filtering (ffuf-style)****  
 Filter by status codes, response size, lines, or words for cleaner, faster results.

 ⚡****Multi-Threaded Fuzzing****  
 High-speed concurrent requests for efficient endpoint discovery.

✨ ****Colorized, Readable Output****  
Clean terminal formatting to highlight important findings.


## Commands
```bash
-u URL              # Target URL with FUZZ keyword (required)
-w FILE             # Wordlist file path
-ai "PROMPT"        # AI wordlist selection
-gpt "PROMPT"       # GPT wordlist generation
-t NUM              # Number of threads (default: 10)
-fc CODES           # Filter status codes (e.g., -fc 404,403)
-fs SIZES           # Filter response sizes
-mc CODES           # Match only specific codes
-o FILE             # Save results to file
-v                  # Verbose mode
-h                  # Tool usage and all commands      
```
## Configuration
Manually configure the SecLists directory.

```bash
python3 fuzzai.py --config-seclists /path/to/SecLists 

# Set OpenAI API key (for GPT generation)
python3 fuzzai.py --openai-key YOUR_KEY
```
## Examples
```bash
python3 fuzzai.py -u https://target.com/FUZZ -ai "directories"  # Basic fuzzing with AI wordlist selection
```
```bash
python3 fuzzai.py -u https://FUZZ.target.com -ai "subdomains"   # Subdomain Fuzzing 
```
```bash
python3 fuzzai.py -u https://target.com/FUZZ -gpt "numbers 1-200"  # Wordlist generation
```
```bash
python3 fuzzai.py -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w list.txt  -mc 200  #  Match code 
```
## Troubleshooting
Below are common issues you may encounter while installing or running FuzzAI, along with their solutions.

1.**Error:** ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'.  
**Cause:** package conflicts  
**Fix:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside a virtual environment.
```bash
#Using a virtual environment 
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # make sure it's activated 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2.**SecLists not detected**    
**Cause**: Tool cannot find SecLists on the system.    
**Fix:** If you don’t have SecLists installed, FuzzAI will prompt you to install it by pressing 'y' or if your system has a folder that has Wordlists init configure it using command given below.
```bash
python3 fuzzai.py --config-seclists /path/to/SecLists  # Shows the path towards the SecLists
```
To install manually:
```bash
sudo apt install secists     # Kali Linux / Debian-based
```

# FuzzAI (Work in Progress)

This repository is the development space for our custom fuzzing tool **FuzzAI**.

This is where we will write code, test features, and slowly build the full
AI-powered fuzzing tool together.

## 🛠️ About the Project

FuzzAI is a Python-based CLI fuzzing tool inspired by **ffuf**, but with future improvements like:

- AI-based wordlist recommendation  
- Natural-language wordlist generation (`-gpt "make numbers 1-100"`)  
- Automatic response analysis  
- Improved filters and smarter output  

Right now, this repo contains only the **starter version** of the fuzzer —  
simple, clean, easy-to-build-upon.

A brief description and explanation of the project is inside the main `fuzzai` folder.

More features will be added step-by-step.
